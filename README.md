# Class Scheduling Project
personal algorithms project  
currently a work in progress  
only works on windows machines for the time being!  
documentation and comments will be updated soon  
The goal of this project is to create a database that will take course requests from a high school with many students, and determine, when and where classes should be held to minimize conflicts. Based on my own experience at Lane Tech High School
